# Bookworm

Welcome to my Bookworm App repository! This app is a personal project I've been working on, and it's all about helping book enthusiasts, like myself, keep track of their reading lists, reviews, and ratings.

## Features

In this app, you can:

- Add and manage all your favorite books.
- Write and store reviews for any book.
- Rate the books you've read.
- Benefit from the app's persistent storage feature.
- Enjoy the dark mode feature, which I personally love.

## Technologies

I built this project using:

- **SwiftUI**: An amazing UI toolkit that allows for a more declarative way of designing apps.
- **Core Data**: I chose this for managing the model layer of the application, especially for its persistent data storage capabilities.

## Development Status

**Heads up!** This app is still a work in progress. I'm actively adding new features and refining the existing ones. So, it might not be in its final state, and some features may change as I continue to develop.

I would love to hear feedback or suggestions for improvements. If you've got any ideas or notice any issues, please let me know, either by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

## How You Can Contribute

If you'd like to join me in this venture:

1. Feel free to fork the repository.
2. Create a branch (please give it a meaningful name).
3. Make your magic happen.
4. Submit a pull request.

I genuinely appreciate all the help and will review all pull requests!

## Future Plans

- I'm aiming to enhance the user interface and overall experience.
- Implementing more advanced book management features is on my list.
- I'd love to add a feature that allows for sharing.
- I'm continuously working on improving data management.

## Disclaimer

Since this is still under development, there might be some quirks or bugs. Kindly bear with me, and remember, I'm always working to get everything polished and up to the mark.
